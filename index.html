            <h1>THE GIRL WITH THE ROSE-RED SLIPPERS: A MYTH ABOUT LOVE.</h1>
        </header>

        <div>
        <p>Well the country that is home to one of Earth's oldest civilizations gave the world one of history's first peace treaties.<br>Located on the NorthEast corner of africa, Egypt is home to one of the world's earliest and greatest civilizations, with a unified kingdom first surfacing around 3,200 B.C.</p>
        <p>Ever wonder where Cinderella originated? Well, this is the tale of a Greek girl named RHODOPIS who was sold into slavery in Egypt.<br> A very kind man bought her and, in turn, provided her with beautiful gifts.<br> One day, an eagle swooped down and stole one of her rose-red slippers. It was delivered to the Pharaoh Amasis. Amasis asked to  meet the owner of that slipper and rest, shall we say, is history.<br> The two fell so deeply in love they even died on the same day. </p>
        <p id="para1">"Pharaoh" means "Great House," a reference to the place where the pharaoh resides.<br> While early  Egyptian rulers were called "Kings," over time the  name "Pharaoh" stuck.</p><br>

         <p>Although the  story's title and main character's name change in different languages, in English-language folklore Cinderella is an archetypal name.<br>The word Cinderella has, by analogy, come to mean one whose attributes were unrecognized:one who unexpectedly achieves recognition or success after a period of obscurity and neglect.<br>The still popular story of Cinderella continues to influence popular culture internationally, lending plot elements allusions, and tropes to a wide variety of media. </p><br>
